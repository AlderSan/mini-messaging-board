# mini-messaging-board
A mini messaging board project

Built using node.JS and Express backend, offering a simple messaging board with the ability to add new messages and view messages on their own. 

New message submitting was changed from standard HTML form POST submit to a .JSON POST submit method to gain experience with .JSON transmitting.

Pages were built using Bootstrap framework.
